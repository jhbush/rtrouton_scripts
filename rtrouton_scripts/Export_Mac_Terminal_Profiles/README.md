This script is used to export individual macOS Terminal.app profiles to a `com.apple.Terminal.plist` file. These plist files can then be converted into configuration profiles for deployment.

To use this script, please use the following procedure:


1. Identify the name of the Terminal profile you want to export.
2. Double-click on the **Export_Mac_Terminal_Profiles.command** script.
3. Enter the name of the Terminal profile you want to export.
4. Decide if you want the exported Terminal profile to be set up as a default profile. [By specifying it as a default profile, the exported Terminal profile will be configured as both a startup profile and as a default profile](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/default-startup-terminal-window-profiles-trml5856b1f2/2.10/mac/10.15).
