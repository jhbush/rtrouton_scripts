This script imports a list of usernames from a plaintext file  and uses that information to generate a report about the computers assigned to that username.

Usage: `./Generate_Assigned_Mac_Report_From_Jamf_Pro_Usernames.sh usernames.txt`

The script can also accept one username as input, if a plaintext file containing usernames
is not available.

Usage: `./Generate_Assigned_Mac_Report_From_Jamf_Pro_Usernames.sh`

Plaintext file format should look like this:

```
first_username_goes_here
second_username_goes_here
third_username_goes_here
fourth_username_goes_here
```

Once the username(s) are read from in from the plaintext file or from manual input, the script takes the following actions:

1. Uses the Jamf Pro API to download all information about the matching computer inventory record in XML format.
2. Pulls the following information out of the inventory entry:

*    Jamf Pro ID
*    Assigned user's username
*    Assigned user's email
*    Manufacturer
*    Model
*    Serial Number
*    Hardware UDID

3. Create a report in tab-separated value (.tsv) format which contains the following information
   about the computers.

*    Jamf Pro ID
*    Assigned user's username
*    Assigned user's email
*    Manufacturer
*    Model
*    Serial Number
*    Hardware UDID
*    Jamf Pro URL for the computer inventory record

The report generated by script should appear similar to what is shown below:

```
Jamf Pro ID Number	Assigned User	Assigned User Email	Make	Model	Serial Number	UDID	Jamf Pro URL
56894	username	username@company.com	Apple	15-inch Retina MacBook Pro with TouchID (Mid 2017)	C0CD3782EBD12	BCD409C2-4716-4A6C-B317-9D59B2B67658	https://jamf.pro.server.here/computers.html?id=56894
98324	username	username@company.com	Apple	15-inch Retina MacBook Pro with TouchID (Mid 2017)	C060DC6F2C6D	4059B073-11D2-4DE1-A2C4-1B8B78D3D712	https://jamf.pro.server.here/computers.html?id=98324
