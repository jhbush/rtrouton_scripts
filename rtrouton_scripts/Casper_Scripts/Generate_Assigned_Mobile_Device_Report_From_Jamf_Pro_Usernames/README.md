This script imports a list of usernames from a plaintext file  and uses that information to generate a report about the mobile devices assigned to that username.

Usage: `./Generate_Assigned_Mobile_Device_Report_From_Jamf_Pro_Usernames.sh usernames.txt`

The script can also accept one username as input, if a plaintext file containing usernames
is not available.

Usage: `./Generate_Assigned_Mobile_Device_Report_From_Jamf_Pro_Usernames.sh`

Plaintext file format should look like this:

```
first_username_goes_here
second_username_goes_here
third_username_goes_here
fourth_username_goes_here
```

Once the username(s) are read from in from the plaintext file or from manual input, the script takes the following actions:

1. Uses the Jamf Pro API to download all information about the matching mobile device inventory record in XML format.
2. Pulls the following information out of the inventory entry:

*    Jamf Pro ID
*    Assigned user's username
*    Assigned user's email
*    Model
*    Serial Number
*    Hardware UDID

3. Create a report in tab-separated value (.tsv) format which contains the following information
   about the mobile devices.

*    Jamf Pro ID
*    Assigned user's username
*    Assigned user's email
*    Model
*    Serial Number
*    Hardware UDID
*    Jamf Pro URL for the mobile device inventory record

The report generated by script should appear similar to what is shown below:

```
Jamf Pro ID Number	Assigned User	Assigned User Email	Model	Serial Number	UDID	Jamf Pro URL
12529	username	username@company.com	iPhone 7	Q54SH9RBGE7L	bf194a626a06457fadb34c059469931a	https://jamf.pro.server.here/mobileDevices.html?id=12529
32725	username	username@company.com	iPhone SE	M27SH9RBGQ9E	1682cf67691240bd8587b99b34decb8d	https://jamf.pro.server.here/mobileDevices.html?id=32725
```
