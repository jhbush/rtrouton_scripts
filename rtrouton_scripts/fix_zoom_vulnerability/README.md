The script is designed to address the Zoom vulnerabilities described in CVE-2019â€“13450:
[https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13450](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13450)

In the Zoom Client through 4.4.4 and RingCentral 7.0.136380.0312 on macOS,  
remote attackers can force a user to join a video call with the video camera active. 
This occurs because any web site can interact with the Zoom web server on localhost port 19421 or 19424. 

NOTE: a machine remains vulnerable if the Zoom Client was installed in the past and then uninstalled. 
Blocking exploitation requires additional steps, such as the `ZDisableVideo` preference and/or killing the web server, 
deleting the `~/.zoomus` directory, and creating a `~/.zoomus` plaintext file.

The script performs the following actions:

Stops the **ZoomOpener** and **RingCentralOpener** processes for the logged-in user.

Sets `/Library/Preferences/us.zoom.config.plist`  to disable Zoom video auto-connection

Checks the existing user folders in /Users for the presence of the Library/Preferences directory.
Once the Library/Preferences directory is located, script sets the individual users'
`~/Library/Preferences/us.zoom.config.plist`  to disable Zoom video auto-connection.

Next, the script checks for the presence of the `~/.zoomus` and 
the `~/.ringcentralopener` directories in users' home folders. 
If these directories are detected, the following actions take place:

* If present, the `~/.zoomus` directory is deleted.
* A file named `~/.zoomus` is created.
* The `~/.zoomus` file is set to be unreadable and unwritable.
* The `~/.zoomus` file is set to be owned by the owner of the home folder.

* If present, the `~/.ringcentralopener` directory is deleted.
* A file named `~/.ringcentralopener` is created.
* The `~/.ringcentralopener` file is set to be unreadable and unwritable.
* The `~/.ringcentralopener` file is set to be owned by the owner of the home folder.
